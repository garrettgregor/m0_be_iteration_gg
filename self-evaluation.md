# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
    - I felt like I got stuck for a little bit using the conditional operators in conjuction with the `each` command
    - I also feel like I don't remember the technical vocabulary particularly well here yet, but I do have the syntax down even if I don't remember every vocabulary word.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
    - I definitely had some productive struggle here - I was able to check google, test things through `irb`, and leverage cohort-mates to help break through what I was doing wrong
    - I also had some unproductive struggle where I think I would have come to the conclusion sooner or on my own had I realized that `irb` was storing my code, which in turn I think was giving me errors later on.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    - I think that I still have a ways to go on learning the technical vocabulary and being able to combine logical and conditional operators with what we've been learning.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    - I have questions still about which technical vocab describes which actions, so I'm going to have to put some time on my calendar to review the lessons about arrays and used `spaced repetition` to try to learn better.
